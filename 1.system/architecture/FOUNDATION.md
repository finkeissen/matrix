# Foundation Scope and Terminology Alignment

This document records the current **foundational scope**
and **terminology alignment** of the Matrix repository.

It exists to make explicit what is otherwise implicit.

---

## Foundational Domains (Active)

The following domains constitute the **current foundational core**
of the Matrix system:

- `research-program` — epistemic boundaries and assumptions
- `mms` — structural invariants and identity
- `matrix` — execution and meta-level stress environment
- `informatics` — formal recursion and computability limits
- `physics` — external formal reality anchor

These domains are intentionally prioritized because they test:
- epistemic validity
- structural identity
- formal limits
- self-reference
- real-world consistency

All other domains are currently **out of scope** for active development.

---

## Paused Domains

Domains not listed above are considered **paused**.

This means:
- no new runs are expected
- no structural migration is required
- existing material is retained as-is
- presence does not imply maturity or endorsement

Paused domains are not deprecated.
They are intentionally deferred.

---

## Terminology Alignment (Binding)

Across all foundational domains, the following terminology rules apply:

- The Matrix does **not** contain facts.
- The Matrix does **not** assert truth.
- The Matrix operates exclusively on **epistemic artifacts**.

Epistemic artifacts include:
- claims attributed to sources
- relations between claims
- scope and applicability constraints
- conflicts and incompatibilities
- uncertainty and evidence qualifiers
- gaps and explicit non-knowledge
- runs and snapshots

Any appearance of factuality is treated as
an external assumption, not a Matrix entity.

---

## Structural Interpretation

- Completeness is not a goal.
- Consistency is not enforced.
- Conflict is not an error.
- Uncertainty is not a defect.
- Silence is a valid outcome.

Structure is evaluated by **survivability under load**,
not by apparent clarity.

---

## Change Policy

Changes to:
- the set of foundational domains, or
- the global terminology rules

must be made explicitly by updating this document.

Implicit drift is considered a structural failure.

---

## Status

This document reflects the current foundational phase
of the Matrix system.

It is expected to change infrequently.

## On Schema, Terminology, and Language Uniformity (Binding)

The Matrix does **not** assume a unified schema, terminology,
or language layer across domains, runs, or phases
at the current foundational stage.

Structural, terminological, and linguistic heterogeneity
is **intentional** and treated as a **diagnostic signal**, not as a defect.

This explicitly includes differences in:
- structural schemas and representations
- field names and formats
- conceptual labels
- synonyms and near-synonyms
- natural languages (e.g. EN, DE)

Schema alignment, terminology harmonization,
synonym resolution, and multilingual consolidation
are **explicitly deferred** to a later exploratory phase.

They must **not** occur:
- implicitly
- silently
- during raw → pre-matrix migration
- inside pre-matrix material
- inside domains
- inside runs
- or inside MMS

Any future harmonization:
- occurs explicitly in `exploratory/`
- is reversible and traceable
- preserves original phrasing and language
- never overwrites historical artifacts

Premature normalization of structure, terms, or language
is considered a **structural risk**
because it collapses epistemic variation
before it has been tested.

Uniformity, if it emerges at all,
must be **earned through comparison and failure**,
not imposed by design.
