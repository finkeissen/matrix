# Research Program Architecture
## Epistemic Inquiry Without Privilege or Closure

---

## Status

This document is **normative** for the Research Program architecture.

It specifies how research questions, methods, assumptions,
and outcomes are represented **within the Matrix**,
without introducing epistemic authority, truth claims,
or external justification layers.

---

## 1. Research Program as Artifact Space

The Research Program is not external to the Matrix.

It exists entirely as:
- artifacts,
- relations,
- runs,
- annotations,
- evaluations.

There is no “research context” outside the artifact graph.

Research activity is a **mode of use**, not a separate system.

---

## 2. Core Research Artifacts

The Research Program operates on explicit artifact types, including:

- **Question**  
  Explicitly formulated epistemic questions with declared scope.

- **Problem**  
  Structured articulations of uncertainty, tension, or non-knowledge.

- **Method**  
  Declared procedures, heuristics, or workflows.
  Methods do not imply correctness.

- **Assumption**  
  Explicit background commitments or idealizations.
  Assumptions are never implicit.

- **Run**  
  Executions of methods on artifacts under declared conditions.

- **Result**  
  Outputs of runs, without default epistemic authority.

All research content must appear in one of these explicit forms
or as declared extensions.

---

## 3. No Privileged Epistemic Position

The Research Program does **not** grant:

- truth,
- correctness,
- priority,
- realism,
- or authority

to any artifact by virtue of being “research output”.

Research status is **descriptive**, not justificatory.

Empirical success, coherence, or usefulness
may be recorded only as annotations or evaluations,
never as implicit elevation.

---

## 4. Assumption Discipline (Binding)

Every research artifact must declare:

- its assumptions,
- its scope of applicability,
- its intended purpose.

Undeclared assumptions are treated as **structural omissions**,
not as defaults.

Conflicting assumptions are admissible.
Resolution is optional.

---

## 5. Failure and Negative Results

The Research Program explicitly admits:

- failed runs,
- negative results,
- breakdowns of methods,
- scope violations,
- unresolved problems.

Failure is a **first-class research outcome**.

There is no bias toward success or convergence.

---

## 6. Reflexive Research (Self-Inquiry)

The Research Program may formulate questions about:

- itself,
- its methods,
- its assumptions,
- the MMS,
- the Matrix,
- the DBMS layer.

Such reflexive inquiries are subject to the same constraints
as all other research artifacts.

There is no protected core.

---

## 7. Separation from Evaluation and Policy

The Research Program does **not**:

- rank results,
- select preferred models,
- enforce relevance,
- or recommend actions.

Any such behavior must be introduced explicitly
as **policy artifacts**, scoped and versioned.

Research produces material.
Policy decides use.

---

## 8. Explicit Non-Goals

The Research Program does **not** aim to:

- converge to final theories,
- establish foundations,
- eliminate uncertainty,
- guarantee progress,
- or stabilize consensus.

Any appearance of closure must be explicitly marked,
scoped, and contestable.

---

## 9. Architectural Invariant (Binding)

> The Research Program generates epistemic artifacts,
> not epistemic authority.

Inquiry is permitted everywhere.
Privilege is permitted nowhere.
