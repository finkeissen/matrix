# conflict

This directory documents **conflict representation conventions**
used within the Matrix.

Conflict is treated as a **first-class structural element**.

Conflict records incompatibility.
It does **not** assign error, blame, priority, or resolution.

---

## Purpose of Conflict Representation

Conflict exists to make **disagreement explicit**.

Many epistemic systems fail not because they are wrong,
but because they **hide or collapse conflict**.

The Matrix represents conflict to:
- preserve parallel claims
- prevent silent normalization
- expose structural tension
- support auditability

---

## What Constitutes a Conflict

A conflict is an explicit statement of **incompatibility**
between two or more artifacts.

Incompatibility may arise from:
- mutually exclusive assertions
- incompatible scopes
- conflicting assumptions
- divergent definitions
- irreconcilable methods

Conflict does **not** require symmetry.
One-sided conflict representations are permitted.

---

## Conflict Is Not Error

Conflict must not be interpreted as:
- falsity
- incorrectness
- low quality
- failure of representation

Conflict may indicate:
- genuine disagreement
- different contexts
- unresolved questions
- limits of current structure

The Matrix does not privilege harmony over disagreement.

---

## Explicit Conflict Artifacts

Conflicts should be represented explicitly as artifacts.

A conflict artifact typically references:
- the involved artifacts
- the type of incompatibility
- the scope of conflict
- relevant assumptions (if known)

Conflicts must not be implied or inferred implicitly.

---

## Conflict vs. Difference

Not all differences constitute conflicts.

A conflict requires:
- a defined incompatibility
- an explicit statement of that incompatibility

Mere variation, plurality, or diversity
does not automatically imply conflict.

---

## Conflict Across Domains

Conflicts may:
- exist within a single domain
- span multiple domains
- involve meta-domains

Domains must not suppress conflicts
for the sake of internal coherence.

Cross-domain conflict is expected.

---

## Conflict Persistence

Conflicts may persist indefinitely.

The Matrix does **not** require:
- resolution
- prioritization
- synthesis

Resolution, if it occurs,
must be represented explicitly
as an additional artifact,
not as deletion of conflict.

---

## Conflict and Runs

Runs may:
- surface new conflicts
- formalize previously implicit tensions
- record failed attempts at reconciliation

Runs must not silently remove conflicts.

Conflict disappearance requires
explicit representation and justification.

---

## Explicit Non-Goals

Conflict representation must not:
- score claims
- rank positions
- decide outcomes
- enforce consensus
- simulate adjudication

Any such operation lies
outside the Matrix scope.

---

## Summary

> **Conflict preserves epistemic honesty.  
> Its presence is a feature, not a defect.**

The Matrix treats unresolved disagreement
as a stable and valuable state.
