# Levels of Analysis — matrix

## Status of this document
This document is **normative** for level separation in `matrix`.

It does not resolve epistemic tensions.
It makes them explicit and enforceable.

Violations of level separation are treated as
**structural failures**, not content errors.


---

## Why levels are necessary

Most epistemic failures do not arise from false statements,
but from **unmarked transitions between levels of analysis**.

Typical collapses include:
- description → evaluation
- evidence → conclusion
- model output → decision
- agreement → truth
- compliance → legitimacy

`matrix` exists to make such transitions explicit,
inspectable, and contestable.


---

## The three mandatory levels

`matrix` operates with **three strictly separated levels**.

These levels are not metaphysical claims.
They are **operational constraints**.

---

### Level 1 — Object level

**What lives here:**
- statements about the world
- data, measurements, observations
- models and model outputs
- policies, rules, procedures
- decisions and actions

**Typical forms:**
- “X happened.”
- “The model outputs Y.”
- “Policy P requires Z.”

**Key property:**
Object-level items **do not justify themselves**.

They may be true or false,
effective or ineffective,
but they carry **no inherent authority**.


---

### Level 2 — Meta level

**What lives here:**
- claims *about* object-level items
- admissibility judgments
- scope limitations
- validity or applicability assessments
- interpretations of evidence or outputs

**Typical forms:**
- “This claim is admissible.”
- “This evidence supports (but does not prove) X.”
- “This model output is valid under assumptions A–C.”

**Key property:**
Meta-level statements **confer conditional status**,
never absolute authority.

They remain revisable.


---

### Level 3 — Meta² level

**What lives here:**
- constraints on how meta-level judgments may be formed
- STOP rules
- level-transition rules
- non-negotiable structural limits

**Typical forms:**
- “This transition is illegitimate.”
- “Further inference would be self-sealing.”
- “STOP: authority is being assumed without basis.”

**Key property:**
Meta²-level rules do **not argue**.
They **intervene**.


---

## Level transitions (the critical point)

Transitions between levels are:

- permitted only when **explicitly marked**
- never automatic
- always contestable

### Examples of illegitimate transitions

- Object → Meta  
  “The data shows X, therefore X is true.”

- Meta → Object  
  “This is admissible, therefore it must be done.”

- Object → Meta²  
  “This model is accurate, so STOP rules don’t apply.”

- Meta² → Object  
  “This is structurally illegitimate, so the content is false.”

All of these are category errors.


---

## Normativity and unavoidable breaks

Level separation itself is a **normative imposition**.

It cannot be derived from facts.
It cannot be proven without circularity.

From a strict foundational perspective,
this makes it **unzulässig**.

However:

Without this imposition:
- everything becomes self-justifying,
- no STOP is possible,
- no boundary can be enforced.

The system therefore **carries this break openly**.

It is not resolved.
It is managed.


---

## Relation to runs

Runs operate **within** this level structure.

A run may:
- expose an illegitimate transition,
- demonstrate how a collapse occurs,
- or reserve space for such an analysis.

Runs do not redefine levels.
They test failures against them.


---

## Relation to STOP rules

STOP rules always operate at **Meta² level**.

They do not:
- refute content,
- decide correctness,
- or resolve disagreement.

They prevent further progression
when progression itself becomes illegitimate.


---

## What this document does not claim

This document does not claim that:
- object-level truth is inaccessible,
- meta-level evaluation is sufficient,
- meta²-level constraints are final.

It claims only that **unmarked level collapse is epistemically destructive**.


---

## Practical implication

Any contribution to `matrix` must be readable as:

- clearly object-level,
- clearly meta-level,
- or clearly meta²-level.

If this cannot be determined,
the contribution is structurally invalid.


---

## Final note

Level separation does not guarantee correctness.
It guarantees **inspectability**.

Inspectability is the minimum condition
under which disagreement, revision,
and responsibility remain possible.
