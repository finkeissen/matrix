# Admissibility

This document defines the **minimum conditions**
under which an artifact may enter the Matrix repository.

Admissibility is not endorsement.
It is a gate against noise, opinion, and implicit authority.

---

## Scope

Admissibility applies to:

- fillets
- gap artifacts
- stress-test documentation
- any future diagnostic artifacts

No artifact bypasses this gate.

---

## Minimum Requirements

An artifact is admissible **only if all conditions are met**.

### 1. Explicit Transfer

The artifact must identify a **specific illegitimate transfer**, e.g.:

- method → world
- structure → truth
- success → justification
- description → norm
- meta-position → privilege

Vague criticism is insufficient.

---

### 2. Domain Independence

The transfer must be describable **without domain expertise**.

If understanding the artifact requires
specialized background knowledge,
it is not admissible.

Domain-specific examples may be used,
but they must be removable
without collapsing the diagnosis.

---

### 3. Counterfactual Test

At least one **counterfactual condition** must be stated.

It must be clear what would have to change
for the transfer to *not* occur.

Artifacts that cannot fail are inadmissible.

---

### 4. Scope Limitation

The artifact must state **what it does not claim**.

No artifact may imply:

- universal invalidation
- historical dismissal
- metaphysical replacement
- normative authority

Silence outside scope is mandatory.

---

## Explicit Exclusions

The following are **not admissible**:

- opinions
- value judgments
- rhetorical critiques
- historical narratives without diagnostic function
- examples without a generalizable transfer
- attempts to introduce new epistemic levels
- attempts to bypass stop rules

---

## Relation to STOP

If analysis reaches a point where:

- further decomposition adds no epistemic value
- justification becomes purely speculative
- no admissible transfer can be isolated

**STOP must be issued.**

STOP is a valid outcome.

---

## Governance

Admissibility is conservative by design.

In cases of doubt:
- rejection is preferred
- silence is preferred
- non-admission is not failure

No artifact gains authority by inclusion.
No artifact gains authority by persistence.

---

## Meta-Constraint

This document applies to itself.

Any claim of exemption
must be explicit and justified.


# Admissibility Gate

This document defines the **minimum conditions** under which
any artifact may enter the Matrix as admissible for inspection.

Admissibility is **structural**, not epistemic.

## A. Illegitimate Transfer

An artifact is inadmissible if it performs an implicit transfer between:
- formal description → normative conclusion
- aggregate evidence → individual prescription
- model behavior → world behavior
- consistency → correctness
- coherence → truth

without explicit binding conditions.

## B. Required Properties

An admissible artifact must:
- identify the specific transfer being attempted
- describe the transfer without domain expertise
- state at least one counterfactual under which the transfer fails
- declare its scope explicitly

## C. Explicit Exclusions

The following are **never admissible**:
- rhetorical critique
- historical commentary without diagnostic value
- opinion or value assertion
- examples without a generalizable transfer pattern

Failure to meet these criteria results in **structural refusal**.


## Occam Constraint

No new structure is admissible unless it is strictly necessary.

Necessary means:
- it resolves at least two independent tensions already present, or
- it prevents a recurrent category error that cannot be blocked locally.

Otherwise: do not add structure. Prefer silence.
