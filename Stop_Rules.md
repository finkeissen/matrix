# Stop Rules

This document defines **explicit termination conditions**
for analysis within the Matrix repository.

STOP is not failure.
STOP is a valid outcome.

---

## Scope

These rules apply to:

- fillets
- gap artifacts
- stress tests
- any diagnostic or analytic activity

No artifact overrides STOP.

---

## Mandatory STOP Conditions

Analysis **must stop** if any of the following holds.

### 1. No Isolatable Transfer

If no specific illegitimate transfer
can be clearly identified.

Vague suspicion is insufficient.

---

### 2. Non-Falsifiability

If the diagnosis cannot fail
under any conceivable counterfactual.

Unfalsifiable analysis is inadmissible.

---

### 3. Pure Decomposition

If further analysis only refines language,
adds distinctions, or increases detail
without changing epistemic outcome.

---

### 4. Speculative Bridging

If continuation requires speculative
ontological, normative, or metaphysical bridges.

---

### 5. Authority Substitution

If critique begins to function as
implicit authority or moral leverage.

---

## Silence Clause

Silence is permitted.
Closure is not required.
Unresolved status is acceptable.

---

## Governance Rule

STOP decisions are final
unless new admissible material is introduced.

Persistence does not reopen analysis.

---

## Meta-Constraint

These rules apply to themselves.

No exemption is implicit.


# STOP Rules

STOP rules are **structural safeguards**.
They are not conclusions and do not imply error.

## SR-01 — Implicit Authority

Triggered when a claim acquires authority
without explicit justification of scope and responsibility.

## SR-02 — Illegitimate Transfer

Triggered when a transfer between epistemic levels
is performed implicitly or without binding conditions.

## SR-03 — Self-Sealing Reasoning

Triggered when a claim justifies itself
by reference to its own coherence, acceptance, or persistence.

## SR-04 — Exhausted Decomposition

Triggered when further analysis adds no new diagnostic distinction.

## Effect of STOP

When STOP is triggered:
- analysis halts
- no verdict is produced
- Absence or Gap is recorded
- responsibility remains external to the Matrix
