# Stop Rules

This document defines **explicit termination conditions**
for analysis within the Matrix repository.

STOP is not failure.
STOP is a valid outcome.

---

## Scope

These rules apply to:

- fillets
- gap artifacts
- stress tests
- any diagnostic or analytic activity

No artifact overrides STOP.

---

## Mandatory STOP Conditions

Analysis **must stop** if any of the following holds.

### 1. No Isolatable Transfer

If no specific illegitimate transfer
can be clearly identified.

Vague suspicion is insufficient.

---

### 2. Non-Falsifiability

If the diagnosis cannot fail
under any conceivable counterfactual.

Unfalsifiable analysis is inadmissible.

---

### 3. Pure Decomposition

If further analysis only refines language,
adds distinctions, or increases detail
without changing epistemic outcome.

---

### 4. Speculative Bridging

If continuation requires speculative
ontological, normative, or metaphysical bridges.

---

### 5. Authority Substitution

If critique begins to function as
implicit authority or moral leverage.

---

## Silence Clause

Silence is permitted.
Closure is not required.
Unresolved status is acceptable.

---

## Governance Rule

STOP decisions are final
unless new admissible material is introduced.

Persistence does not reopen analysis.

---

## Meta-Constraint

These rules apply to themselves.

No exemption is implicit.
