# Gap Candidate Run Template: Mathematical structure missing

This is a **run template** (not an executed run).

Purpose:
- Attempt to construct an admissible path for: **Mathematical structure missing**
- If no admissible path exists, terminate with **STOP + GAP**.

This template must be instantiated into a dated run directory under:
`2.runs/YYYY-MM-DD/run_XX_gap_mathematical_structure_missing/`

No file in `2.runs/...` should be treated as authoritative without
an executed run record and provenance.

## Expected Terminal Outcome
Default expectation: **STOP + GAP**
(Unless a strictly admissible construction is discovered.)

## Notes
- Do not add assumptions, heuristics, or proxies to bypass a Gap.
- If you produce a Gap, record:
  - triggered STOP condition
  - scope
  - missing information / missing structure
  - blocked claims
