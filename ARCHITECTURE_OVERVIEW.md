# matrix

## Status

`matrix` is an epistemic boundary-control system.

It regulates the admissibility, level-transitions, and structural legitimacy
of claims, distinctions, and judgments.

It is **not** a knowledge base, decision engine, or truth-evaluation framework.


---

## Core function

The purpose of `matrix` is to:

- expose illegitimate conceptual transfers,
- prevent category collapse,
- enforce explicit level distinctions,
- detect self-sealing reasoning structures.

The system evaluates structural admissibility — not truth.


---

## Runs

A *run* is a diagnostic operation.

It may:
- test a boundary,
- isolate a specific illegitimate transfer,
- or reserve architectural space for such a test.

Runs are process units, not claims.

They may:
- generate artifacts,
- remain minimal,
- or exist purely as structural boundary markers.

The absence of substantive artifacts does **not** imply incompleteness.


---

## Structure

Runs are append-only.

Each run lives in its own directory:

2.runs/YYYY-MM-DD/run_XX_stresstest_<name>_claim/


Each run contains at minimum:

- `README.md`
- `stress_test.md`

Additional artifacts are optional and run-specific.


---

## Levels of analysis

`matrix` enforces strict separation between:

1. Object level  
2. Meta level  
3. Meta² level  

Implicit elevation between levels is treated as structural failure.

See `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` for formal constraints.


---

## STOP rules

STOP rules are structural safeguards.

They are triggered when:
- a distinction collapses into its own justification,
- the system becomes self-sealing,
- or authority is assumed without structural basis.

A STOP does not indicate failure.
It prevents epistemic illegitimacy.


---

## Normative constraints

`matrix` necessarily introduces normative constraints.

These constraints are:

- not derivable from facts,
- not universally justified,
- and not epistemically neutral.

They are explicitly acknowledged as structurally necessary,
but not foundationally ultimate.

This tension is carried openly.


---

## What matrix does not do

`matrix` does not:

- determine truth,
- decide policy,
- resolve ethical disputes,
- substitute judgment.

It regulates structural admissibility only.


---

## Progress criteria

Progress is measured by:

- clearer boundary articulation,
- reduced implicit transfers,
- increased resistance to self-sealing reasoning.

Not by accumulation, consensus, or closure.




---

## Freeze

A freeze indicates architectural sufficiency,
not epistemic completeness.

Completeness would imply closure.
Closure would imply authority.
Authority would violate the system’s own constraints.
