# matrix/ROLES.md

## Purpose
This file lists roles as **descriptive labels** used in Matrix entries.
It defines no authority, no process, and no admissibility rules.

Roles here are **observational**:
- who acted
- who carried responsibility
- who executed
- who audited

- **Admissibility Gate (MMS)**

## Notes
- Roles may be combined in real situations; this is a labeling convenience.
