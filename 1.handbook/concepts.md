# Concepts

This document clarifies **core concepts** used throughout the Matrix repository.

It does not define a theory.
It does not impose interpretations.
It does not claim completeness.

Its purpose is to make the **intended meaning of recurring terms explicit**
so that disagreement can be about substance,
not about hidden assumptions.

---

## Artifact

An **artifact** is any explicit element represented in the Matrix.

Artifacts are **not facts** and **not truths**.
They are structured representations of epistemic elements.

Artifacts may include:
- claims
- relations
- scopes
- conflicts
- gaps
- metadata
- run records
- observations

Artifacts are the **only things** the Matrix directly contains.

---

## Claim

A **claim** is an explicit statement attributed to a source.

A claim:
- is bound to provenance
- is bound to time
- is bound to assumptions
- may conflict with other claims
- may later be revised or superseded

Claims do **not** become facts
by virtue of inclusion in the Matrix.

Multiple incompatible claims may coexist indefinitely.

---

## Fact

A **fact** is **not** a Matrix concept.

When the term “fact” appears,
it refers to an **external assumption**
made by a reader or consuming system.

The Matrix does not validate,
establish,
or recognize facts.

If something appears factual,
it is treated as a claim
whose factual status lies outside the Matrix.

---

## Assumption

An **assumption** is an explicit condition
under which a claim is asserted or interpreted.

Assumptions may include:
- methodological constraints
- definitions
- background theories
- measurement conditions
- contextual limitations

Assumptions are **first-class elements**.

Implicit assumptions are considered
structural failures, not conveniences.

---

## Scope

**Scope** defines where a claim is intended to apply.

Scope may be:
- spatial
- temporal
- conceptual
- methodological
- conditional

A claim without scope
is structurally incomplete.

Conflicts often arise
not from disagreement about content,
but from incompatible or implicit scopes.

---

## Conflict

A **conflict** is an explicit representation
of incompatibility between claims.

Conflict does **not** imply error.
It does **not** imply resolution is required.
It does **not** imply symmetry or equivalence.

Conflict is represented
because unresolved disagreement
is often epistemically informative.

---

## Gap

A **gap** represents explicit non-knowledge.

Gaps may indicate:
- missing data
- unasked questions
- unresolved contradictions
- structural blind spots
- STOP conditions

Gaps are preserved intentionally.

Filling a gap without justification
is considered a structural failure.

---

## Observation

An **observation** is an artifact produced by a run
that records a **noticed structural pattern**
among existing artifacts.

Observations:
- do not introduce new claims
- do not resolve conflicts
- do not fill gaps
- do not assert interpretations

They describe **what was noticed during a run**,
not **what should be concluded**.

Observations may refer to patterns such as:
- convergence or divergence of terminology
- localization or dispersion of conflicts
- explicitness of assumptions or scopes
- stability or volatility across revisions
- density of dependencies within a domain

Observations are:
- explicitly attributable to a run
- bound to time and configuration
- revisionable only via subsequent runs

Observations are **not**:
- evaluations
- judgments
- scores
- indicators of truth
- indicators of correctness
- indicators of domain maturity

Any interpretation of observations
lies outside the Matrix.

---

## Domain

A **domain** is a bounded epistemic stress environment.

A domain specifies:
- admissible artifact types
- relation semantics
- uncertainty tolerance
- explicit non-goals

Domains are **not disciplines**.
They are **contexts for structured exposure**.

Different domains may represent
the same material differently
without requiring reconciliation.

---

## Run

A **run** is a recorded execution
of the Matrix Management System (MMS).

A run:
- applies specific constraints
- processes specific inputs
- produces specific artifacts
- surfaces conflicts and gaps
- may record observations

A run does **not**:
- assert truth
- validate claims
- resolve disagreements

Runs make structure **traceable**.

---

## Snapshot

A **snapshot** is a frozen view
of a Matrix state.

Snapshots are produced as exports.
They are immutable.

A snapshot:
- reflects a specific moment
- does not constrain future evolution
- does not imply endorsement

Snapshots exist to support
inspection and comparison,
not authority.

---

## Provenance

**Provenance** describes the origin of an artifact.

It includes:
- source reference
- time of assertion
- extraction or creation context
- transformation history

Provenance is mandatory.
Artifacts without provenance
are structurally invalid.

---

## STOP Condition

A **STOP condition** marks a boundary
beyond which further reasoning is illegitimate
under the current assumptions.

STOP conditions prevent:
- implicit extrapolation
- silent normativity
- unbounded inference

STOP conditions may be revised,
but never ignored.

---

## Structural Failure

A **structural failure** occurs when:
- assumptions are implicit
- scopes are missing
- conflicts are collapsed
- gaps are silently filled
- authority is implied

Structural failure is distinct from
being wrong.

The Matrix is designed
to surface structural failure early.

---

## Summary

> **The Matrix operates on structure, not belief.  
> Its concepts exist to make disagreement explicit,
> not to eliminate it.**

Understanding these concepts
does not require agreement with them —
only awareness.
