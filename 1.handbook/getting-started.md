# getting started

This document provides an **orientation path** into the Matrix repository.

It is not a tutorial.
It does not explain how to “use” the Matrix.
It does not assume agreement with its premises.

Its sole purpose is to help readers **not get lost**.

## What This Repository Is (First Contact)

If this is your first encounter with the Matrix:

- it is **not** a knowledge base
- it does **not** tell you what is true
- it does **not** offer conclusions or decisions
- it does **not** converge toward answers

The Matrix exists to test whether **epistemic structure**
can survive under conditions of:
- uncertainty
- disagreement
- incomplete information
- conflicting sources

If you are looking for answers, recommendations, or summaries,
this repository will likely frustrate you.

That is intentional.

## How to Read This Repository

This repository is **not meant to be read linearly**.

Different readers may enter at different points.

Recommended entry points:

- If you want **a high-level orientation**:  
  → start with `matrix/readme.md`

- If you want to understand **the architectural contract**:  
  → read `handbook/research-program_mms_matrix.md`

- If you want to see **what is currently represented**:  
  → explore `domains/`

- If you want to understand **how structure is produced**:  
  → inspect `runs/`

- If you want to see **unfinished or exploratory material**:  
  → look into `work/`

---

## What to Expect (and What Not)

You should expect:
- explicit uncertainty
- visible disagreement
- incomplete structures
- parallel representations
- absence of synthesis

You should **not** expect:
- resolution of conflicts
- authoritative explanations
- prioritization or ranking
- recommendations
- final states

If something feels “unfinished”,
that does not mean it is broken.

## Common Initial Misunderstandings

**“Why doesn’t the Matrix just decide which claim is correct?”**  
Because decision-making is explicitly outside its responsibility.

**“Why are there multiple conflicting claims side by side?”**  
Because conflict is treated as a first-class structural element.

**“Why is there so much emphasis on structure and so little on answers?”**  
Because answers collapse uncertainty; structure exposes it.

**“Why is this so strict about boundaries?”**  
Because most epistemic failure occurs at boundary violations.

---

## A Note on Patience

The Matrix is deliberately slow to reward understanding.

Its design favors:
- explicitness over convenience
- transparency over usability
- survivability over elegance

If you stay with it,
clarity emerges — but not quickly, and not comfortably.

---

## Where to Go Next

After this document, a natural next step is:

- `handbook/concepts.md`  
  for clarification of key ideas and terms

Or, if you prefer concrete material:

- `domains/`  
  to see how epistemic artifacts are represented

## Summary

> **This repository does not guide you to conclusions.  
> It guides you away from hidden assumptions.**

That is the only promise it makes.
