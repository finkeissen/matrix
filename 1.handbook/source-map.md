# source map

This document provides a **structural map of external sources**
that inform, motivate, or challenge the Matrix.

It is **not** a bibliography.
It is **not** a literature review.
It does **not** establish authority or priority.

Its purpose is to make **influences, inputs, and points of contact explicit**
so that no source acquires hidden epistemic weight.

---

## Purpose of the Source Map

The Matrix integrates material from many origins:
- books
- academic literature
- notes and drafts
- prior repositories
- exploratory documents

Without explicit mapping,
such material risks becoming
implicitly authoritative.

The source map exists to prevent that.

---

## Categories of Sources

Sources are grouped by **functional role**,
not by status, quality, or prestige.

A single source may appear in multiple categories.

---

## Foundational Influences

These sources have **shaped the design space**
of the Matrix architecture.

They inform:
- boundary choices
- epistemic caution
- treatment of uncertainty
- rejection of implicit authority

Inclusion here does **not** imply agreement.

Examples may include:
- epistemology and philosophy of science
- critical theory of knowledge systems
- meta-scientific critiques
- formal reasoning under uncertainty

---

## Conceptual Counterpoints

These sources represent:
- alternative epistemic models
- competing design philosophies
- approaches explicitly not adopted

They are included to make **rejection explicit**.

Disagreement with a source
is as important as influence by it.

---

## Domain-Specific Inputs

These sources provide **raw or structured material**
for specific domains.

They may include:
- textbooks
- empirical studies
- datasets
- domain literature
- field-specific repositories

Domain-specific inputs:
- do not define domain structure
- do not determine admissibility
- do not override conflicts

They enter the Matrix only as
explicit claims with provenance.

---

## Methodological References

These sources inform:
- extraction methods
- representation strategies
- tooling ideas
- structural experiments

They influence **how material is handled**,
not **what is accepted**.

---

## Prior Repositories and Drafts

This includes:
- earlier versions of this project
- related repositories
- abandoned or superseded approaches
- exploratory prototypes

These sources are retained for:
- historical context
- failure analysis
- comparison

They do **not** define the current system.

---

## Explicit Non-Sources

Equally important are things
the Matrix explicitly does **not** derive from.

Examples may include:
- consensus rankings
- authority-weighted aggregations
- decision-support systems
- optimization frameworks
- policy or governance models

Listing non-sources prevents
implicit drift toward them.

---

## How to Use This Document

This document should be updated when:
- a new major influence is introduced
- a source is consciously rejected
- a prior assumption is revised

Updates should describe:
- *why* a source matters
- *how* it is used
- *where its influence stops*

Vagueness is preferable to false precision.

---

## Summary

> **Sources influence the Matrix.
> They do not speak through it.**

The source map exists to make that distinction
explicit and durable.
