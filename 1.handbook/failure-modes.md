# failure modes

This document lists **known and anticipated failure modes**
of the Matrix architecture.

It is not exhaustive.
It is not predictive.
It does not provide remedies.

Its purpose is to make **structural risk explicit**
so that failure does not occur silently.

---

## Why Failure Modes Are Documented

The Matrix is designed to expose epistemic failure.

However, the Matrix itself
is not immune to failure.

Documenting failure modes:
- does not prevent them
- does not resolve them
- does not assign blame

It ensures that when failure occurs,
it is **recognizable**.

---

## Category Errors

One of the most common failure modes
is the collapse of architectural layers.

Examples include:
- treating Matrix artifacts as facts
- treating runs as conclusions
- treating domains as knowledge bases
- treating exports as authoritative references
- treating the handbook as policy

These errors typically arise
from external expectations,
not internal design.

---

## Hidden Normativity

Despite explicit boundaries,
normativity may re-enter implicitly.

Typical indicators:
- language suggesting correctness or preference
- unmarked prioritization of claims
- silent exclusion of alternatives
- convergence pressure without justification

Hidden normativity is particularly dangerous
because it often appears as “neutral cleanup”.

---

## Authority Leakage

Authority leakage occurs when:
- sources gain weight through repetition
- certain domains are treated as more “real”
- meta-domains begin to dominate other domains
- technical sophistication is mistaken for validity

Authority leakage undermines
the anti-eminence principle.

---

## Premature Stabilization

Stabilization becomes a failure mode when:
- provisional structures are treated as final
- lack of change is mistaken for correctness
- absence of conflict is interpreted as resolution
- convenience discourages revision

Stability in the Matrix
must be observed, not assumed.

---

## Schema Overreach

Schemas are necessary,
but they can overreach.

Overreach occurs when schemas:
- encode meaning instead of structure
- enforce uniform interpretation
- suppress heterogeneity
- become substitutes for judgment

Schema violations are visible.
Schema overreach is often not.

---

## Loss of Provenance

Provenance erosion occurs when:
- sources are summarized beyond traceability
- transformations are undocumented
- intermediate steps are discarded
- runs are treated as implementation detail

Without provenance,
artifacts lose epistemic value
even if structure remains intact.

---

## Instrumentalization

The Matrix may be misused as:
- a justification engine
- a credibility shield
- a decision-support proxy
- a source of selective evidence

Such uses lie outside
the responsibility of the Matrix,
but they remain a real risk.

---

## Over-Interpretation of Gaps

Gaps are intentional.

A failure occurs when:
- gaps are treated as errors to fix
- gaps are filled with assumptions
- gaps are used to imply conclusions
- silence is mistaken for absence

Gaps represent limits,
not invitations to speculate.

---

## Reader Projection

Readers may project:
- their own goals
- their own epistemic standards
- their own decision needs

onto the Matrix.

This often results in frustration,
misinterpretation,
or attempts to “complete” the system.

---

## Self-Referential Blindness

The Matrix may fail
by not applying its own principles to itself.

Indicators include:
- undocumented design changes
- implicit shifts in terminology
- untracked evolution of assumptions
- resistance to documenting internal conflict

Self-reference is not optional.

## Summary

> **Failure is not the enemy of the Matrix.  
> Unrecognized failure is.**

This document exists
to make failure visible —
not to eliminate it.
