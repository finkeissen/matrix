# Glossary

This glossary provides **concise reference definitions**
for recurring terms used across the Matrix repository.

It complements `handbook/concepts.md`.

Definitions here are:
- descriptive, not normative
- operational, not theoretical
- scoped to this repository only

If a glossary entry conflicts with
system definitions or domain artifacts,
the glossary is wrong by definition.

---

## Artifact

An explicit element represented in the Matrix.
Artifacts are structured epistemic representations,
not facts or truths.

---

## Claim

A statement attributed to a source,
bound to time, provenance, and assumptions.

Claims may conflict and coexist indefinitely.

---

## Fact

Not a Matrix concept.
Refers only to external assumptions made by readers
or consuming systems.

---

## Assumption

An explicit condition under which a claim is asserted
or interpreted.

Implicit assumptions are considered
structural failures.

---

## Scope

The defined applicability range of a claim.
Missing scope renders a claim structurally incomplete.

---

## Conflict

An explicit representation of incompatibility
between claims.

Conflict does not imply error or required resolution.

---

## Gap

Explicitly represented non-knowledge.

Gaps are preserved intentionally
and must not be silently filled.

---

## Observation

A run-bound, descriptive artifact
recording an **observed structural pattern**
among claims, relations, or domains.

Observations describe what was noticed,
not what it means.

They may refer to patterns such as:
- convergence or divergence of terminology
- localization or dispersion of conflicts
- explicitness of assumptions or scopes
- stability or volatility across revisions
- density of dependencies

Observations are:
- non-normative
- explicitly attributable to a run
- revisionable only through subsequent runs

Observations are **not**:
- evaluations
- judgments
- scores
- indicators of truth
- indicators of correctness
- indicators of domain maturity

Any interpretation of observations
lies outside the system.

---

## Domain

A bounded epistemic stress environment
with defined admissibility and relation rules.

Domains are not disciplines or ontologies.

---

## Run

A recorded execution of MMS
documenting structural behavior under constraints.

Runs establish provenance, not truth.

---

## Snapshot

A frozen representation of a Matrix state,
produced as an export.

Snapshots are immutable and non-authoritative.

---

## Provenance

Information describing the origin,
context, and transformation history of an artifact.

Mandatory for all domain artifacts.

---

## STOP Condition

A declared boundary beyond which further reasoning
is illegitimate under current assumptions.

STOP conditions prevent silent extrapolation.

---

## Structural Failure

A failure of explicitness or constraint,
such as implicit assumptions,
collapsed conflict,
or hidden normativity.

Distinct from being factually wrong.

---

## Matrix

The non-authoritative instantiation
of structured epistemic artifacts
produced by MMS runs.

---

## MMS (Matrix Management System)

The rule-bound operative system
that processes inputs
and produces Matrix artifacts
under research-program constraints.

---

## research-program

The epistemic framework
defining admissibility, scope,
and limits of legitimate reasoning.

Produces no empirical claims or results.

---

## Export

A frozen, externally consumable representation
derived from the Matrix state.

Exports do not modify the Matrix.

---

## Summary

> **The glossary stabilizes language.
> It does not stabilize meaning.**

Terms remain open to refinement,
but never to silent drift.
