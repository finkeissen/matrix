# Reading Guide

This document provides **suggested reading paths**
through the Matrix repository.

It does not prescribe an order.
It does not imply priority.
It does not assume shared goals.

Its purpose is to reduce **orientation errors**,
not to optimize understanding.

---

## Why a Reading Guide Is Necessary

The Matrix is intentionally:
- non-linear
- non-authoritative
- non-convergent

Readers approaching it with different expectations
will otherwise draw incompatible conclusions
about what the repository is meant to do.

The reading guide exists to make
**those expectations explicit**.

---

## If You Want to Understand What This Is

Start here:

1. `matrix/readme.md`  
2. `handbook/research-program_mms_matrix.md`  
3. `handbook/getting-started.md`

This path clarifies:
- what the Matrix is
- what it is not
- where responsibility boundaries lie

Stop here if your interest is purely conceptual.

---

## If You Want to Understand How It Is Structured

Start here:

1. `system/readme.md`  
2. `handbook/concepts.md`  
3. `handbook/glossary.md`

This path focuses on:
- structural roles
- conceptual vocabulary
- internal consistency

It does **not** explain usage or workflows.

---

## If You Want to Inspect the Current State

Start here:

1. `domains/`  
2. domain-level `readme.md` files  
3. referenced `runs/`

This path shows:
- what is currently represented
- how it is structured
- under which conditions it entered the Matrix

Do not assume completeness or stability.

---

## If You Want to Follow Provenance

Start here:

1. `runs/`  
2. run manifests and logs  
3. referenced system versions

This path is for:
- audit
- traceability
- comparison across time

It is intentionally technical and repetitive.

---

## If You Want to See Unfinished or Exploratory Work

Start here:

1. `work/readme.md`  
2. `work/exploration/`  
3. `work/pre-matrix/`

This path exposes:
- alternative structures
- abandoned approaches
- unresolved questions

Nothing here is authoritative.

---

## If You Are Looking for Answers

This repository is unlikely to satisfy that goal.

The Matrix does not:
- synthesize
- prioritize
- decide
- recommend

If you are looking for outcomes,
you are expected to build them **outside**
this repository,
using it only as a structural reference.

---

## How to Read Observations

Some domains include **observations**.

Observations are:
- run-bound
- descriptive
- explicitly attributable
- structurally derived

Observations describe **patterns that were noticed**,
not conclusions that were reached.

They may point to, for example:
- convergence or divergence of terminology
- localization or dispersion of conflicts
- explicitness of assumptions or scopes
- stability or volatility across revisions
- density of internal dependencies

Observations do **not**:
- evaluate claims
- rank domains
- measure quality
- declare maturity
- imply correctness or truth

Different runs may produce
different observations over the same material.

This is expected.

---

## Common Misreadings This Guide Tries to Prevent

- treating domains as facts  
- treating runs as conclusions  
- treating exports as truth  
- treating the handbook as policy  
- treating structure as endorsement  
- treating observations as evaluations  

If you notice yourself doing any of these,
return to `matrix/readme.md`.

## Summary

> **The Matrix does not reward speed.  
> It rewards careful reading.**

This guide exists to help readers
choose *where* to be careful.
