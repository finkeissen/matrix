# Axioms

## Purpose

This document describes what is treated as **axiomatic** in the *current argumentative state* of the project.

Here, “axiomatic” does **not** mean:
- true
- necessary
- foundational in a logical sense
- immune to critique

It means:

> **explicit assumptions that are currently taken as given  
> in order to make argumentation possible.**

All axioms described here are:
- time-bound
- revisable
- disputable
- attributable

They describe a state, not a commitment.

---

## What “axiomatic” means in this project

In this project, axioms are understood as:

- assumptions that are *not argued for* within a given state
- but *about which arguments can be made*
- and which may change across states

Axioms are therefore **inside** the argumentative space,
not beneath it.

They are visible so that:
- their influence can be traced
- their consequences can be examined
- their revision can be documented

---

## Current axiomatic assumptions

The following assumptions characterize the current argumentative state.
They are recorded descriptively, not prescriptively.

### Axiom 1 — Argumentative Primacy

Arguments are treated as the primary objects of interest.

The project does not operate on facts, truths, or knowledge claims,
but on articulated positions with provenance and scope.

---

### Axiom 2 — Explicitness over Implicitness

Implicit assumptions are considered a structural failure.

Wherever possible, assumptions, scopes, and distinctions
are expected to be made explicit,
even if this increases complexity or reduces readability.

---

### Axiom 3 — Non-Authority

No argument, document, or structure within the project
has inherent authority.

Inclusion records existence and articulation,
not correctness or priority.

---

### Axiom 4 — Temporal States

The project is understood as evolving through
distinct argumentative states.

What is treated as axiomatic in one state
may be revised, rejected, or replaced in another.

There is no assumption of convergence or finality.

---

### Axiom 5 — Machine-Mediated Legibility

The project accepts that its full structure
is not legible to humans through linear reading alone.

Machine mediation is treated as a necessary condition
for navigating complex argumentative states,
not as an external optimization layer.

---

## Relationship to claims

The axioms described here are **not independent truths**.

They correspond to, and are justified only by,
explicit claims recorded in:

- `claims.jsonl`
- associated relations and sources

If a statement in this document cannot be traced
to explicit claims,
it is considered provisional or obsolete.

---

## Revision and dispute

This document may change.

Changes may occur when:
- new claims contradict existing axioms
- existing axioms are refined or split
- alternative axiomatic configurations are explored

Such changes are expected and recorded.
They do not imply error.

---

## Status

This document describes the **current axiomatic configuration**.

It is not a foundation beneath the project,
but a snapshot of what is presently assumed
in order to argue at all.
