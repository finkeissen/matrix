# Matrix Repository

Public, curated showcase of the Matrix within the Matrix/MMS research program.

## Status

This document defines the scope of validity of this repository.
It defines structural boundaries and admissibility conditions.
It is not a working log and does not function as a development notebook.

---

## Scope of Validity

This repository implements the Matrix as an instantiated component
within a formally bounded research program architecture (Matrix / MMS).

It does **not** constitute:
- a theory of the world,
- an epistemology,
- a truth theory,
- a normative framework,
- or an ontology.

It demonstrates how bounded formal coordination can be implemented.

---

## Geltungsraum (Scope)

All contents of this repository operate within a formally bounded
scope of validity.

The scope is comparable to a `chroot`:
- The real world and broader research context continue to exist.
- Within this repository, only explicitly permitted operations,
  references, and transitions are addressable.
- There is **no interpreter** between system and world.
- All crossings are explicit and marked as breaks.

## Position of the Matrix

The Matrix is an instantiated component within a layered architecture.
It is not the research program itself,
and it does not define the scope of validity.

This document defines the boundary within which the Matrix operates.
All Matrix-specific behavior is specified separately
under `1.system/`.

---

## 0.legacy/

Contents under `0.legacy/` are part of the repository
but **not part of the system architecture**.

They document inherited bodies of knowledge and serve exclusively
as raw material for later structural decomposition.

Their presence implies **no recognition** of truth, validity,
or structural authority.

---

## Language Architecture

The formal prerequisites of the system are treated under the field
**Language Architecture**.

Language Architecture defines:
- structural conditions of formal articulation,
- admissible forms of symbolic operation,
- and limits of formal systems.

It makes **no claims** about meaning, truth, or reality.

---

## Boundary Topics

Topics such as logic, mathematics, truth, incompleteness, reality,
or knowledge are handled strictly within their **formal scope**.

Any implicit transfer:
- from formal properties to the world,
- from provability to truth,
- from structure to normativity,

is considered **inadmissible**
and triggers refusal or STOP.

---

## Architecture Progression

The research program follows a strictly layered construction.
Later components do not ground earlier ones.

The intended build-up is:

1. **Language Architecture (Luftschloss)**  
   Formal preconditions for symbolic systems, models, and interpretation.  
   No ontology, no semantics, no truth claims.

2. **Model Toolkit**  
   A construction kit for building explicit models:  
   states, parameters, relations, observation layers, and purposes.  
   Models are artifacts, not explanations.

3. **DBMS Layer**  
   Storage, versioning, provenance, and audit of artifacts and runs.  
   The DBMS is intentionally blind to meaning and truth.

4. **MMS (Meta-Model System)**  
   Coordination, constraint enforcement, comparison, and composition  
   of models within the admissible system scope.

5. **Matrix Instantiations**  
   Concrete, task-bound model configurations for analysis,  
   experimentation, or application.

No layer licenses an ontological or epistemic upgrade of earlier layers.
Pragmatic success at higher layers does not retroactively ground
lower layers in reality.

Note: Files like `stress_test.md` are generated and stored per run under `2.runs/...`, not as a single global document in the root.

## Repository Character

This repository is intentionally curated.

It demonstrates:
- structural layering,
- admissibility constraints,
- formal artifact schemas,
- and a small number of representative example runs.

It does **not** aim to provide:
- exhaustive domain coverage,
- a comprehensive dataset,
- or a complete knowledge archive.

## Work Status

Open tasks, development order, and working notes
are not part of this document
and are maintained separately from the scope definition.
