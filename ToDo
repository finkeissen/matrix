# ToDo — Matrix Alignment & Pre-Production Control

This file tracks **all required work items**
needed to keep the repository aligned with the current
Matrix principles and architecture.

This is an operational checklist.
Not a vision document.
Not a README.

Completeness is intentional.

---

## STATUS SUMMARY

- Fillet system: structurally complete
- Epistemic levels: explicit
- Authority sources: delegitimized
- Production: intentionally blocked

Remaining work is **governance, gating, and alignment**.

---

## A. DECISIONS (FINAL — NO ACTION REQUIRED)

These decisions are fixed and must not be reopened
without explicit justification.

- [x] Fillets are diagnostic artifacts, not knowledge claims
- [x] English is the canonical language
- [x] Fillet types are frozen (no new types)
- [x] Fillets are organized by epistemic level:
  - atomic (E0)
  - claim (E1)
  - structural (E2)
  - meta (E3)
- [x] Structural hierarchy does not imply epistemic hierarchy
- [x] Meta-level artifacts have no privilege
- [x] Legacy artifacts do not gain authority by persistence
- [x] No implicit authority from:
  - history
  - structure
  - consensus
  - success
  - reflexivity

---

## B. REQUIRED GOVERNANCE (OPEN)

These items are **mandatory** before any scale-up,
collaboration, or content production.

### B1. Admissibility Gate

- [ ] Create `Admissibility.md`

Minimum required criteria:
- explicit illegitimate transfer identified
- transfer describable without domain expertise
- at least one counterfactual condition
- clear scope limitation

Explicit exclusions:
- examples without a general pattern
- opinions or normative positions
- rhetorical critiques
- historical commentary without diagnostic value

_No artifact enters the system without passing this gate._

---

### B2. Stop Rules / Exit Criteria

- [ ] Create `Stop_Rules.md`

Must define:
- when analysis stops deliberately
- when justification is considered locally sufficient
- when silence is the correct outcome
- when further decomposition adds no epistemic value

Purpose:
- prevent infinite critique
- prevent meta-authority
- enforce epistemic restraint

---

## C. NON-KNOWLEDGE HANDLING (OPEN)

Matrix explicitly allows for unresolved space.
This must be structurally represented.

### C1. Gap Artifacts

- [ ] Define minimal artifact type:
  - Gap
  - Underdetermined
  - Unresolvable

Constraints:
- very small number
- no speculative filling
- no implied progress narrative

---

### C2. Gap Documentation

- [ ] Create `Gaps/README.md`
- [ ] Add 1–2 canonical gap examples only

Gaps are first-class outcomes,
not failures.

---

## D. STRUCTURAL VALIDATION (OPEN)

### D1. Stress Tests

- [ ] Select 2–3 high-risk inputs, e.g.:
  - policy document
  - economic forecast
  - AI safety claim
  - philosophical grand theory

- [ ] Apply existing fillets only
- [ ] Document:
  - where structure holds
  - where it collapses
  - where gaps appear

Rules:
- no new fillets during stress tests
- no theory production
- failures must be recorded, not fixed

---

## E. README ALIGNMENT (OPEN)

Readmes must reflect **constraints**, not ambition.

- [ ] Align root README (if present)
- [ ] Align `legacy/README.md`
- [ ] Ensure references to:
  - admissibility
  - stop rules
  - non-knowledge
- [ ] Remove any implication of:
  - completeness
  - authority
  - progress narrative

---

## F. CHANGE & MUTATION CONTROL (OPTIONAL / DEFERRED)

Not required for solo work,
but necessary for collaboration.

- [ ] Define when an artifact is:
  - superseded
  - deprecated
  - withdrawn
- [ ] Define minimal versioning semantics

Deferred unless external contributors are added.

---

## G. PRODUCTION (EXPLICITLY BLOCKED)

### G1. Knowledge Production

- [ ] Domain expansion
- [ ] Case accumulation
- [ ] Synthesis
- [ ] Educational material

⛔ Blocked until sections B–E are completed.

---

## GUIDING MATRIX CONSTRAINTS

- Matrix does not know
- Structure precedes content
- No implicit authority
- Failure must be visible
- Silence is a valid outcome

Progress is measured by
**constraints established**, not artifacts produced.


# Architecture Overview — matrix

## Status of this document
This document is **normative** for the structure of `matrix`,
but **not epistemically complete**.

It defines constraints, distinctions, and admissibility boundaries.
It does **not** define truth, correctness, or final meaning.

All definitions herein are **explicitly provisional**.


---

## Purpose of matrix

`matrix` is not a knowledge repository.

It is a **system for regulating the conditions under which claims,
distinctions, and judgments may be formed, tested, or rejected**.

Its primary function is **epistemic boundary control**, not content accumulation.

The system is designed to:
- expose illegitimate transfers between conceptual levels,
- prevent category collapse,
- make epistemic failure modes explicit *before* they become implicit assumptions.


---

## Runs: epistemic status

A *run* is not a claim, result, or conclusion.

A run is a **diagnostic operation** whose sole purpose is to:
- test a specific boundary,
- isolate a specific illegitimate transfer,
- or reserve conceptual space for such a test.

Runs may:
- produce artifacts,
- remain minimal,
- or exist purely as boundary markers.

The absence of substantive artifacts does **not** indicate incompleteness.
It indicates that a distinction has been identified without being executed.


---

## Intentional minimality and placeholders

Placeholder runs are **intentional**.

They exist to:
- fix a conceptual distinction,
- prevent future category collapse,
- and constrain where content may later appear.

A placeholder run is **not pending completion**.
It is complete with respect to its architectural function.


---

## Levels of analysis (non-negotiable distinction)

The system operates on multiple, strictly separated levels:

1. **Object level**  
   Statements, models, data, policies, decisions.

2. **Meta level**  
   Claims *about* object-level statements
   (validity, admissibility, scope, authority).

3. **Meta² level**  
   Constraints on how meta-level claims may be formed,
   including STOP rules and admissibility limits.

No statement may be elevated between levels
without an explicit, inspectable transition.

Implicit level-shifts are treated as failures.


---

## STOP rules and epistemic safety

STOP rules are **structural safeguards**, not conclusions.

They are triggered when:
- a distinction collapses into its own justification,
- a system becomes self-sealing,
- or a claim acquires authority it cannot justify.

A STOP is not an error.
It is a signal that further progression would be epistemically illegitimate.


---

## System boundaries

`matrix` does not decide:
- what is true,
- what should be done,
- or which values ought to prevail.

It regulates only:
- what may be claimed,
- how claims may be framed,
- and where justification is structurally insufficient.

All normative decisions occur **outside** the system,
but may be *analyzed* within it.


---

## On normativity and unavoidable breaks

The system necessarily introduces **normative constraints**.

These constraints are:
- not derivable from facts alone,
- not universally valid,
- and not epistemically innocent.

They are **explicitly acknowledged as unzulässig** in a strict foundational sense,
yet **necessary** to prevent total epistemic collapse.

This tension is not resolved.
It is carried openly.


---

## Methodological position

Progress in `matrix` is not measured by:
- accumulation,
- consensus,
- or closure.

Progress consists in:
- clearer boundary articulation,
- fewer implicit transfers,
- and increased resistance to self-sealing reasoning.

Failure is expected.
Opacity is not.


---

## What matrix is not

`matrix` is not:
- an ontology,
- a policy engine,
- a decision system,
- a truth-evaluation framework,
- or a substitute for judgment.

Any use that treats it as such
constitutes a category error.


---

## Open-endedness and freeze

The structure of `matrix` may be frozen at any time.

A freeze indicates:
- architectural sufficiency,
- not epistemic completeness.

Further content may be added,
but only within existing boundaries
or via explicitly versioned extensions.


---

## Final note

The system remains intentionally incomplete.

Completeness would imply closure.
Closure would imply authority.
Authority would violate the system’s own constraints.

This is not a flaw.
It is the condition under which the system remains usable.
